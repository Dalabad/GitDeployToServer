# Why should I use this?
Instead of including login credentials in a publicly available repository, you can use this script to use dummy data in the repository and replace it with the real data upon deploying.

# What does it do?
- The script clones a specified github repository in a specified folder.
- After cloning is done, it replaces the dummy data with the real credentials.
